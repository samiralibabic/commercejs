# Webshop Example

This is a simple webshop example showcasing the usage of Commerce.js, MUI, and Stripe.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Log in or create an account on [Commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/).
2. Go to the "Developer" section and copy your API key (public).
3. Create a new file named `.env` at the root of the project.
4. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid publishing sensitive data.
5. Inside the `.env` file, assign your Commerce.js API key to the variable `REACT_APP_CHEC_PK`.
   For example: `REACT_APP_CHEC_PK=your_key_here`
6. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
7. Start the project with `npm start`.

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before running the above commands.

Please note that by ignoring the `.env` file, you are preventing the API key from being exposed in your version control system. This is important to ensure the security of your application.

Happy coding!
